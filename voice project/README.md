- Click "Start Test Call" to begin
- Monitor call status in real-time

### 3. Review Call Results

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS with a custom color scheme. Modify `tailwind.config.js` to change:
- Primary colors (currently blue theme)
- Success/warning colors
- Component spacing and sizing

### Data Structure
The components use mock data that can be easily replaced with:
- API calls to your backend
- Database connections
- Real-time updates from your voice system

### Adding New Features
- Create new components in the `src/components/` directory
- Add navigation items in `App.js`
- Extend the conversation flow structure in `AgentConfiguration.js`

## Integration Points

### Backend API (Future Implementation)
- **Agent Configuration**: POST/PUT endpoints for saving agent settings
- **Call Triggering**: POST endpoint to initiate calls via Retell AI
- **Call Results**: Webhook endpoint to receive call completion data
- **Data Storage**: Database integration for persistent configuration and results

### Retell AI Integration
- **Call Initiation**: API calls to start voice agent conversations
- **Webhook Handling**: Receive real-time call updates and transcripts
- **Agent Logic**: Implement conversation flow based on stored configuration

## Browser Support

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Development Notes

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with sidebar navigation
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with React hooks
- **Error Handling**: Form validation and user feedback throughout

## Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**: Implement FastAPI backend with Supabase integration
2. **Voice System**: Connect to Retell AI for actual call functionality
3. **Authentication**: Add user management and role-based access
4. **Real-time Updates**: Implement WebSocket connections for live call monitoring
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Add call performance metrics and insights

## Support

For questions or issues:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify all dependencies are installed correctly
3. Ensure Node.js version compatibility
4. Review the component structure for customization needs
